- 👋 Hi, I’m Kun（@kunan-au）
- 👀 I’m interested in  Bridging the gap between advanced computing data science and practical business applications, especially in the realm of finance and investment banking. I am particularly fascinated by the power of data in transforming financial risk assessment and decision-making processes.

My education also encompasses a Bachelor's in Business Administration in Jilin University, Zhuhai; providing a solid foundation in business principles and practices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects or initiatives that align with my interest in financial risk and data analysis.
